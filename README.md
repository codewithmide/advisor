The Advisor app uses a third-party API to generate random pieces of advice. The API used is [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable), which provides a collection of advice statements that the application can use.

The application is built using TypeScript, which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. This helps to prevent bugs and improve the overall reliability of the code. The styling for the application is written in SCSS, which is a preprocessor that allows for more powerful and flexible CSS styling.

This repository is open-source, so feel free to contribute to the project by submitting a pull request. If you find any bugs or issues, please report them by opening an issue on the repository.

Thank you for using the Advisor app! We hope that the advice generated by this application is helpful and thought-provoking.
