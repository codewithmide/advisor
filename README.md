## API

The Advisor app uses a third-party API to generate random pieces of advice. The API used is [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable), which provides a collection of advice statements that the application can use.

## Technology

The application is built using TypeScript, which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. This helps to prevent bugs and improve the overall reliability of the code. The styling for the application is written in SCSS, which is a preprocessor that allows for more powerful and flexible CSS styling.

Thank you for using the Advisor app! We hope that the advice generated by this application is helpful and thought-provoking.
